#### Choose six recent popular movies. Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends) to rate each of these movies that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. There should be at least one movie that not everyone has seen! Take the results (observations) and store them somewhere (like a SQL database, or a .CSV file). Load the information into a pandas dataframe.
